disclaimer:
    the use of thwo or more functon in each sort:
    ->objective: the return of the time of the execution throught the proto sort functions

        ->generate random array of different size
        ->check the time of every sort to sort the array
        -> export the time in file

        --------------------------------------------------

        notes:
        the function to verify sort and to save the sort array to file are almost done
        this way the main file is almost over and will only need the implementations files
